Why don't we have a cookie banner? Because we only use functional cookies - and we don't need to ask for permission for those, according to GDPR. Full disclosure:
- We do have basic web analytics, but we've chosen a privacy-friendly solution, thank you very much.
- We do use cookies for authentication and rewards, but those are secure 1st party cookies, thank you very much. 

So if you're looking for our "cookie policy", here it is:

"**_No marketing/re-targeting cookies, no nasty tracking cookies, only cookies that are needed for our website to work._**"

We will never do to you something we don't want done to ourselves. That means we don't feed the tech giants with info on what you do on our website. We don't track you across websites. We don't record your mouse or behaviour. We don't do any of that. We care about your privacy as much as we care about ours.
