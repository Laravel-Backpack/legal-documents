These Terms and Conditions form the agreement between Backpack, Advocates and Referred Users concerning the Backpack Rewards Program. To participate, Advocates and Referred Users must agree to these terms.

## 1. Definitions

1.1 In these Terms and Conditions, the following definitions will be used.

- **Reward Campaign** means a promotion where we issue a new Discount Coupon and its Reward value which may or may not have specific eligibility criteria.
- **Discount Coupon** means a code or string of characters (either generic or uniquely generated) provided to the Advocate to be shared with a Referred User in order to give the Referred User a discount, and the Advocate a Reward.
- **Reward** means a monetary benefit that Backpack owes the Advocate or Affiliate, in return for the successful referral, in the form of a purchase discount or cash, respectively.

- **Website** means our website: [www.backpackforlaravel.com](https://backpackforlaravel.com)

1.2 Capitalized terms that are not defined here will have the same meaning given to them in the Backpack Terms and Conditions as published on our webpage.

## 2. Scope of Application

2.1 The Backpack Rewards Program allows (1) an Advocate to get a Reward for introducing Backpack to friends, family, acquaintances or the public at large (‘Referred User’) and (2) an Affiliate to get a Reward for publishing or sharing content about Backpack products to their audiences or the public at large.

2.2 By participating or attempting to participate in the Rewards Program as an Advocate:



1. You accept and agree that You, as an Advocate or Affiliate, are bound by these Referral Terms; and
2. You acknowledge that You have read and understood the information concerning the [Backpack Privacy Policy](https://backpackforlaravel.com/privacy-policy) and [Backpack Cookie Policy](https://backpackforlaravel.com/cookie-policy).

2.3 The Backpack Rewards Program offers two mechanism through which Advocates can receive rewards: **Discount Coupons** and **Affiliate Links**.

## 3. Discount Coupons

3.1 Discount Coupons can be given to friends, family, acquaintances etc. When such Referred Users use the Discount Coupon on their first purchase, they get a discount as specified in the respective campaign. If the purchase is successful, the Advocate will also receive a Reward as specified in the respective campaign from which the Discount Coupon was announced (to be used for any product purchase on our Website).

3.2 For Discount Coupons, both the discount given to the Referred User and the Reward given to the Advocate are calculated from the subtotal of the first purchase made by the Referred User. The subtotal is the total amount of his purchase, excluding VAT.

3.3 A unique Discount Coupon can be generated and used by anyone with an active account on the Website. Generally, there is no need for a special registration or permission, unless the campaign has specific conditions for participation.

3.4 **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">In order for a Reward to be awarded to the Advocate, the Referred User has to be a first-time purchaser</span>** on [backpackforlaravel.com](https://backpackforlaravel.com/). If there are any invoices in the Referred User’s account, the Advocate is not eligible for a Reward.

3.5 There is no limit to the amount of times the Advocate can repeat the Discount Coupon referral process with different Referred Users. Each successful referral will generate a reward that Advocates can use on any new purchase on the website.

3.6 **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Only one Discount Coupon can be used for each order on the Website</span>**.

3.7 **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Discount Coupons cannot be used in conjunction with other Discount Coupons or other sales promotions or programs</span>** and are only valid for Product purchases on the Website.

## 4. Affiliate Links

4.1 Advocates who want to engage in our rewards program as Affiliates to receive cash Rewards instead of discounts can request registration as an Affiliate, by sending an email to [affiliates@backpackforlaravel.com](mailto:affiliates@backpackforlaravel.com).

4.2. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Affiliates must represent a registered company or sole-proprietorship and be able to issue invoices for this service.</span>**

4.3 Applications to become an Affiliate will be vetted and reviewed by Backpack within 60 days of Your request and eligibility will be determined at Backpack’s sole discretion.

4.4 Affiliates can utilize a separate mechanism to track and convert visitors to Referred Users - the Affiliate Link. The Affiliate Link is a string of characters that should be placed at the end of a hyperlink to the Website (such as ?ref=myspecialcharacters). **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">When a visitor clicks an Affiliate Link, a cookie is placed on their browser for 30 days</span>**, in order to mark that particular user as having reached the Website from the Affiliate. 

4.5 While the referral cookie is active on the user’s browser, any new Affiliate links that the same user may access from the same browser, will not be effective in changing the Referred User’s attribution.

4.6 If the visitor creates a Backpack account while the cookie is stored on their browser, they become a Referred User and is considered referred by the Affiliate. 

4.7 **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Any first-purchase of such Referred User within 1 year of account creation will generate the Reward for the Affiliate</span>** in accordance with the Reward Campaign associated with the Affiliate link.

4.8 An Affiliate is generally not eligible for Rewards (and should therefore utilize a separate, non-reward, non-affiliate link) when the published content is already paid for by Backpack through a different agreement (i.e. paid posting, sponsorship, wage, services contract). Affiliates may negotiate separate hybrid arrangements where a specific Reward is owed in combination with the paid content.

4.9 For a purchase that was made with both an Affiliate Link and a Discount Coupon, Backpack may offer a limited Reward to Affiliates, for the first purchase of a Referred User, if specified in the Campaign.

4.10 **Backpack will send an automatic email report every 1st of the month to each Affiliate**, detailing their remaining unclaimed Rewards. In order to receive cash for their Rewards, the Affiliate must communicate an invoice (by replying to [affiliates@backpackforlaravel.com](mailto:affiliates@backpackforlaravel.com)). Once that invoice is confirmed as accurate, Backpack will pay it within 30 business days. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If an invoice is not submitted within 12 months of any specific reward which is claimable, the affiliate loses the right to claim such reward. </span>**

4.11 **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Affiliate invoices can only be paid through bank transfer, credit card or PayPal.</span>**

4.12 **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">The minimum accumulated Reward amount required for the Affiliate to issue an invoice and Backpack to make a payment is 100 EUR.</span>**

## 5. Rewards

5.1 Both discounts and cash Rewards are awarded in EURO (€) only.

5.2 The Advocate can see the total of their unclaimed Rewards at any time, on their rewards dashboard page on the Website and may use the Rewards in the check-out process.

5.3 **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Rewards are non-transferable. Only the Advocate or Affiliate can use the rewards they have accrued.</span>**

5.4 **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">If the Advocate is also a registered Affiliate, they can claim their unsettled rewards as cash instead of discount coupons.</span>**

5.5 **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">In the case where a reward was given to the Advocate for a purchase, but that purchase gets refunded, the initial reward is canceled.</span>**

## 6. Terms of Validity

6.1 Discount Coupons are for one-time use and expire as specified in their respective campaign. If not specified, they will be active until we communicate the end of the campaign on the Website.

6.2 In the event that the Referred User or Advocate receives multiple Discount Coupons, **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">only one Discount Coupon can be used per order</span>**.

6.3 In the event that the Referred User or Advocate receives multiple Affiliate Links, only one Affiliate Link can be rewarded.
