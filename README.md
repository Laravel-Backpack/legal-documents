# Backpack Legal Documents

This repo holds all visitor and customer-facing documents we have, for full transparency:
- You can comment if you're unhappy with any of our terms and suggest improvements.
- You can see WHEN we change something, WHY we change it and WHO changed it.
- You can subscribe to changes.

We believe all companies should be this transparent about their legal documents. 
This is what all _fair_ companies should do.
